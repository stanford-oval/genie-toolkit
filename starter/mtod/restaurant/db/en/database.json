The shop's intimate size, burnished red walls, dark wood furniture and simple details create warmth, while our cuisine creates fire. Based on the Ma La Tang concept for numbing (ma), burning (la) and neutral (tang) tastes of Sichuan food, our menu represents the breathtaking range of culinary possibilities fashioned by our chef each day, all using the freshest ingredients. Many people describe our food as orgasmic. The intensity mounts and grows until you reach the top. Then you have to calm yourself, and we have dishes for that, too. Our Sichuan specialties are for the daring palate. Dramatic and challenging, they offer an unforgettable experience. But there is also plenty on the menu for a relaxing dining experience with entrees that offer delicate flavor combinations. In 2015, we opened our second Soho location on Old Bailey Street in a more spacious venue where patrons can bask in the eclectic mix of contemporary and traditional Chinese décor, while enjoying the same fiery and complex flavors that our entrees are renowned for.",

A number of old-style condiment stores continue to adopt traditional ways to produce superb first extract soy sauce in its purest and freshest form, and hand craft beancurd sheets with strong bean taste. A small number of local fishermen are persistently sailing out during the early hours to the South China Sea to catch live fishes and shrimps. In places like Yuen Long, there are a substantial number of vegetable farmers working diligently on their fields. At The Chairman, we have all along tried our best to acquire these freshest among the freshest ingredients, although their prices are slightly higher.",

Kitchen and Bar, This award winning restaurant by Enoteca Group has been a bustling hit since it opened its doors in early 2013 becoming a permanent popular fixture on the streets of SoHo. Designed by award-winning interior designer Kinney Chan, Iberico & Co offers something completely unique to SoHo customers; an airy, spacious and somewhat grand interior with an unpretentious gastro bar feel. “The interior is exactly what we envisioned” says Robert Cooper, director “a glammed up version of the Estacio de Franca in Barcelona, with its black metal arched ceiling”. Concrete walls, black iron, recycled wood, lead glass and wire mesh combines stunningly with mosaic flooring, Portuguese flower tiles and plush cyan blue and magenta pink fabrics. Robert casually describes it as “gastro-railway chic”. Like all Enoteca Group restaurants, the focus is on good food, designed to share and of course with a Spanish and Portuguese inspired menu.",

Designed by celebrated, London-based Ilse Crawford, the interiors are as noteworthy as the art on its walls, entering Duddell's feels like being welcomed into the home of a great art collector - one that also happens to have an in-house Michelin-starred Cantonese restaurant, a lush 2,000 square foot Garden Terrace, and sophisticated salon with artisanal cocktails and vintage champagne.",

The focus is on the juxtaposition of opposites, using wood and stone elements, complimented by varying geometric shapes. The contrast of stillness and movement can be seen though different graphic elements and featured art installations. Be tantalized by our chef’s artistry at either one of our signature sushi bars, or delight yourself in our seasonal chef’s menu in the privacy of your own partitioned seating or private room.",

  "description": "Overlooking the Victoria Harbour at Kennedy Town, Fish & Chick serves UK's all-time favourite - beer-battered fish & chips! Not to miss out any details of how the British have their fish & chips, we have mushy peas and malt vinegar! Knowing different people have different preferences, we offer a variety of fishes, which our customers can choose from. To fulfill the local's preference, we have daily fresh Seabass and Barramundi while the foreigners can have their Cod or Haddock and many others. For those who are health-conscious, they may opt for the pan-fried fresh fishes. We all know that some people may not fancy fish & chips because of many other reasons, but fret not, we have French-style rotisserie chicken which we use fresh chicken from the local market and marinate it with our own special marinade before slow-roasting it. The end result will be a flavourful, tender, juicy chicken meat with a crispy skin. Some of the best reasons to come over to our restaurant is the atmosphere, seaview, excellent food, gentle sea breeze and the occasional splashing of waves. Customers coming with their cameras will want to sit at our semi-outdoor bench to take pictures and enjoy one of the best sunset in Hong Kong! We are a friendly and casual restaurant, therefore, you can relax with your glass of wine or your pint of beer while you have your meal. All our food in the menu are made and prepared with passion and love - from our fish & chips, roasted chicken, hand-prepared snacks & salad and home-made desserts, not forgetting, even our tartar sauce is unique because it is made by us, Fish & Chick!",

The menu for Plat du Jour, meaning 'dish of the day', was created by long-term Swire Hotels collaborator David Laris who made its ever-changing daily specials the bistro's pre-eminent feature. Laris, who is renowned for his success at Sir Terence Conran's Mezzo and his namesake restaurant Laris at Three on the Bund, also ensured Plat du Jour would make waves with its all-time classics such as steak tartare, boeuf bourguignon, moule marinières and tarte tatin. With burgundy leather banquettes, marble table tops, full length mirrors and a traditional mosaic entrance floor, Plat du Jour's interior, designed by Zangellini & Holt Associates, allows our guests to experience the cosy, much-adored Parisian bistro atmosphere.",

  "description": "Beef & Liberty is our modern homage to the original beefsteak clubs and, we hope, the tastiest hamburger you will have tried in a while. We are obsessed with hamburgers. We have spent many years trying to create the perfect burger - one that is juicy, beefy, smoky and downright delicious. We think we have succeeded in our quest for perfection we are delighted to share our obsession with you. We proudly serve hormone-free grass-fed beef. Our beef is from Hereford cattle which are naturally raised by small-scale farmers in the Cape Grim region of Tasmania, which has the cleanest air in the world. Why grass fed beef? Cows naturally eat grass, which produces leaner meat, high in Omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E. We freshly grind the beef in our burgers in-house daily and serve it on a custom-baked white sour-dough roll. Add friends and family, top it off with some great craft beers, house cocktails or a fresh Liberty lemonade and you've got our version of what a perfect hamburger experience should be. Recognized as “the best burger in Hong Kong” by the South China Morning Post and awarded a Bib Gourmand by Michelin. Welcome to Beef & Liberty, we hope you enjoy it.",

A theater of sorts, where your meal is freshly prepared and your drink expertly poured in front of you at our pizza kitchen, chef’s kitchen and cocktail bar. From our communal tables, to our pick-and-choose antipasti platters, pastas and pizzas, everything at Ciao Chow fosters a convivial atmosphere where food is shared among family and friends. With a decidedly Italian touch, Ciao Chow’s interior features monolithic marble counter tops and terrazzo floors blended with an industrial feel of exposed concrete, copper piping and light fixtures. Within our large seating area, our chef’s table can fit up to 10 people to accommodate special requests and occasions. Our customers can be assured that all of the ingredients we use are of the highest quality and our cooking methods authentic. We do not cut costs for cheaper ingredients - period. Who would have thought that basic food ingredients could be so highly complicated? WE DO.",

  "description": "Honor The Beast - Redefining Our Food Culture Located in Sai Ying Pun, Quarter Master is a restaurant that only sources its meat from Bones & Blades, its next-door butchery, and serves quality steaks and burgers. All our meat is imported from family-owned farms where livestock is bred and raised in the pure wilderness. Cattle roam free and graze only on the nutrient-dense grasses, untainted by antibiotics, growth hormones, pesticides or pollutants. The result is a healthy beef with distinctive taste and with all the health and flavour benefits that come from being grass-fed animals. Quarter Master's philosophy is simply a matter of thinking beyond each ingredient and considering the environment from which it came. As well as inspiring a greater sense of social consciousness, the food we provide can extend the scope of creative possibilities in the kitchen – and ultimately enhance the quality of life.",
